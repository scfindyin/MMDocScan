---

## Technical Highlights

### Type System Compliance ✅
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MET:** Updated extractionStore.ts to use TemplateField from @/types/template
- Imported TemplateField from @/types/template
- ExtractionField is now a type alias for TemplateField
- Maintains type consistency across extraction and template UI

### Architecture Patterns Followed ✅
- Components handle API calls directly (NOT store actions) - following TemplateSection.tsx pattern
- Zustand store manages only dirty state tracking (setDirty, clearDirty)
- ShadCN components used throughout (Dialog, Input, RadioGroup, Button, Toast)
- Error handling follows existing patterns with user-friendly messages
- Modal co-located with related components in app/extract/components/

### Database Integration ✅
- Reuses POST /api/templates from Story 3.4
- Reuses PUT /api/templates/:id from Story 3.4
- Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- RLS policies ensure user isolation

## Git Status

**Commit:** 04973ed
**Message:** "Implement Story 3.5: Save Template Flow"
**Branch:** main
**Pushed:** ✅ Yes (origin/main)

**Changes Summary:**
- 6 files changed
- 958 insertions(+)
- 18 deletions(-)
- 1 new component created (SaveTemplateModal.tsx)
- 3 new documentation files (story, context, report)

---

## Database Testing

**Status:** ⏭️ SKIPPED

**Reason:** Story 3.5 reuses existing API endpoints from Story 3.4 (Template CRUD API Endpoints). No new database schema changes were introduced. The templates table with JSONB fields column already exists and has RLS policies configured.

**Verified via Story 3.4:**
- Templates table exists with correct schema
- POST /api/templates endpoint functional
- PUT /api/templates/:id endpoint functional
- RLS policies enforce user isolation
- Duplicate name constraint enforced (UNIQUE user_id, name)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Action
Run `approve-story` workflow to complete Story 3.5 and mark it as DONE in the workflow status.

### Workflow Status Updates Needed
- Mark Story 3.5 as DONE
- Move Story 3.6 (Basic File Upload - Single File) to IN_PROGRESS
- Update STORIES_DONE array to include "3.5"
- Update progress tracking (5 of 30 stories complete = 16.7%)

### Next Story in Queue
**Story 3.6:** Basic File Upload (Single File)
- Prerequisite for Phase 2 batch processing features
- Establishes single-file upload pattern before multi-file (Story 3.8)
- Part of Phase 1 foundation (Stories 3.1-3.7)

## Architect Feedback Summary

### Initial Review (Iteration 1)
**Verdict:** REQUIRES CHANGES
**Issues Found:** 5 critical issues

1. **Type Mismatch:** ExtractionField vs TemplateField - needs single source of truth
2. **Missing Store Actions:** Clarify that components (not store) handle API calls
3. **Dirty State Logic:** Specify simple approach (dirty on change, clear on save)
4. **Duplicate Name Handling:** Client-side check is UX, server-side is source of truth
5. **Store Path:** Incorrect path in dev notes (app/extract/store vs stores/)

### Re-Review (Iteration 2)
**Verdict:** APPROVED
**Issues Resolved:** 5/5

All critical issues addressed in regenerated story with appropriate specificity. Architecture patterns consistent, component boundaries clear, API integration follows existing pattern.

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Architect Review:** Caught 5 critical type system and architecture issues before implementation
2. **Story Regeneration:** SM agent successfully incorporated all architect feedback in iteration 2
3. **Type System Alignment:** Explicit requirement to use TemplateField prevented implementation confusion
4. **Context Pre-Loading:** Workflow instructions mentioned context-manager optimization (though agent still re-read files)

### Areas for Improvement 🔄
1. **Context Passing:** Sub-agents still re-reading files despite context-manager role
2. **File Read Optimization:** Could eliminate ~80% of file I/O with better context passing to agents
3. **Token Usage:** Could reduce token consumption with true context pre-loading

### Recommendations 📋
1. Enhance context-manager to explicitly pass loaded document contents to sub-agents
2. Add explicit "DO NOT RE-READ these files" directive with actual content
3. Consider caching mechanism for frequently-accessed documents across agent spawns

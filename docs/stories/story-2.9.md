# Story 2.9: Extraction Session Management

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want to return to my recent extractions without re-uploading documents,
So that I can re-export or review previous results.

## Context Summary

This story implements session/temporary storage for extraction results to enable users to return to previous extractions without re-uploading documents or re-running AI extraction. The implementation leverages the existing extraction workflow (Story 2.3), results preview UI (Story 2.4), and Excel export functionality (Story 2.8) while adding persistence and navigation capabilities.

**Key Context from Planning Documents:**

- **Tech Spec** (lines 106-119): Current architecture uses in-memory session state only - documents and extraction results held in React state during active session with no persistence. This story adds temporary storage beyond the current processing session.
- **Tech Spec** (lines 155-159): Explicit note that "No document persistence - files held in browser memory only during active session. If user refreshes page or closes browser, they must re-upload documents." This story extends retention without full document persistence.
- **Epic 2 Scope** (epics.md lines 447-465): Story calls for temporary storage (session storage or database), recent extractions list, re-export capability, session persistence, 10-item limit, clear history, and 7-day auto-expiry.

**Implementation Approach:**

The solution will use **Supabase database storage** (not session storage) to persist extraction metadata and results, enabling multi-session access while respecting the "no document persistence" constraint. Documents are never stored - only extraction results (JSON data), template references, and metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC2.9.1:** Extraction results saved to database automatically after successful extraction
   - ExtractedRow[] array stored as JSONB in extractions table
   - Template ID, original filename, extraction timestamp, row count captured
   - Automatic save triggered after Story 2.3 production extraction completes

2. **AC2.9.2:** "Recent Extractions" navigation link accessible from main navigation
   - Link added to app layout navigation (consistent with existing nav items)
   - Link navigates to /extractions route
   - Badge showing extraction count (optional enhancement)

3. **AC2.9.3:** Recent extractions list shows key metadata for each extraction
   - Document name (original filename without extension)
   - Template name (linked from template_id foreign key)
   - Extraction date (formatted as relative time: "2 hours ago", "Yesterday")
   - Row count (number of ExtractedRow items)
   - List sorted by extraction date (newest first)

4. **AC2.9.4:** Clicking recent extraction loads results preview with full functionality
   - Navigates to /extractions/[id] route with extraction details
   - Results preview table reuses Story 2.4 implementation (same UI components)
   - All Story 2.4 features work: sorting, filtering, confidence display, metadata columns
   - Story 2.8 Excel export functionality works without modifications

5. **AC2.9.5:** Recent extractions persist across browser sessions
   - Extractions stored in database (Supabase), not session storage
   - User can close browser, return later, and see previous extractions
   - No re-upload or re-extraction required

6. **AC2.9.6:** System retains 10 most recent extractions per table
   - Oldest extractions automatically removed when limit exceeded
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) retention policy
   - Implemented via database trigger or application logic

7. **AC2.9.7:** "Clear History" option removes old extractions
   - Button on /extractions list page to clear all extractions
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion (destructive action)
   - Success message after clearing

8. **AC2.9.8:** Extractions auto-expire after 7 days
   - Database cleanup job or trigger removes extractions older than 7 days
   - Can be implemented via Supabase scheduled function or manual script
   - No user-visible impact (automatic background cleanup)

9. **AC2.9.9:** Re-export to Excel from saved extraction works without document re-upload
   - "Export to Excel" button on /extractions/[id] page
   - Reuses Story 2.7 Excel generation function
   - Filename format: `[template-name]_[document-name]_[extraction-date].xlsx`
   - Same formatting, confidence highlighting, and metadata as original export

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Storage Strategy:**
- Use **Supabase database** for extraction persistence (not browser storage)
- Store `ExtractedRow[]` as JSONB in `extracted_data` column
- No document storage - only extraction results and metadata
- Align with existing database patterns from Story 1.3 (templates table design)

**Data Retention:**
- 10-item limit enforced at database level (trigger on INSERT)
- 7-day auto-expiry via Supabase scheduled function or manual cleanup script
- Cascade deletion not needed (extractions are leaf nodes in schema)

**Component Reuse:**
- Reuse Story 2.4 results preview table component (`app/process/page.tsx` lines 67-1108)
- Reuse Story 2.8 Excel export logic (`lib/excel/export.ts` generateExcelFile function)
- Reuse Story 2.4 sorting/filtering algorithms
- No new UI patterns needed - follow existing card/table responsive layouts

**Performance Considerations:**
- Index on `extractions.created_at` for fast sorting queries
- JOIN with templates table for template name display
- JSONB storage for extracted_data enables efficient storage of variable-length arrays
- Limit result sets to 10 items maximum (no pagination needed)

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
- `lib/db/extractions.ts` - Data access layer (mirrors `lib/db/templates.ts` pattern)
- `app/api/extractions/route.ts` - GET and DELETE endpoints
- `app/api/extractions/[id]/route.ts` - GET single extraction endpoint
- `app/extractions/page.tsx` - Recent extractions list page
- `app/extractions/[id]/page.tsx` - Extraction details page with results preview
- `types/extraction.ts` - Add ExtractionRecord type (extends existing types)
- `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_extractions_table.sql` - Database migration

**Modified Files:**
- `app/api/extract/production/route.ts` - Add auto-save after extraction (lines ~450-460)
- `app/layout.tsx` - Add "Recent Extractions" navigation link (lines ~30-50)

**Component Extraction Opportunities:**
- Extract results table from `app/process/page.tsx` into reusable `components/extraction-results-table.tsx` component
- This allows both `/process` (live extraction) and `/extractions/[id]` (saved extraction) to use same UI
- Refactor benefits Story 2.4 and 2.9

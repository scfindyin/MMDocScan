2. Confidence score threshold indicator (e.g., < 70% = low confidence)
3. Low-confidence rows visually distinct from high-confidence rows
4. Confidence score tooltip explains scoring (hover for details)
5. Can sort by confidence score (lowest first)
6. Summary stats displayed: "X high-confidence, Y low-confidence rows"
7. Clear indication when no low-confidence rows exist ("All extractions high-confidence")

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Implementation Status:**
Most Story 2.5 acceptance criteria were already implemented in Story 2.4 during the comprehensive results preview table implementation. This story primarily involves:
1. **Validation and Testing** of existing confidence review features
2. **Documentation** of the confidence scoring and review workflow
3. **Potential Minor Enhancements** based on user feedback and edge case testing

**Existing Implementation (from Story 2.4):**

All 7 acceptance criteria are already implemented in `app/process/page.tsx`:

1. **AC1 - Filter Toggle**: Lines 913-927 implement "Show low-confidence only" checkbox
   ```typescript
   <Checkbox
     id="low-confidence-filter"
     checked={showLowConfidenceOnly}
     onCheckedChange={(checked) => setShowLowConfidenceOnly(checked === true)}
   />
   ```

2. **AC2 - Threshold Indicator**: Lines 985-993 implement tooltip showing < 70% threshold
   ```typescript
   <Tooltip>
     <TooltipTrigger asChild>
       <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-muted-foreground" />
     </TooltipTrigger>
     <TooltipContent>
       <p>Low confidence: &lt; 70%</p>
       <p>High confidence: ≥ 70%</p>
     </TooltipContent>
   </Tooltip>
   ```

3. **AC3 - Visual Distinction**: Story 2.4 implemented yellow/orange background for low-confidence rows (confidence < 0.7)

4. **AC4 - Tooltip Explanation**: Same as AC2 - tooltip explains scoring methodology

5. **AC5 - Confidence Sorting**: Lines 979-982 implement clickable Confidence column header with sorting

6. **AC6 - Summary Stats**: Lines 888-911 display "X high-confidence, Y low-confidence rows" with icons
   ```typescript
   <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-green-600">
     <CheckCircle2 className="h-4 w-4" />
     <span>{getRowCounts().high} high-confidence</span>
   </div>
   {getRowCounts().low > 0 && (
     <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-orange-600">
       <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
       <span>{getRowCounts().low} low-confidence</span>
     </div>
   )}
   ```

7. **AC7 - No Low-Confidence Messaging**: Lines 930-939 display celebratory message when all rows are high-confidence
   ```typescript
   {showLowConfidenceOnly && getRowCounts().filtered === 0 && (
     <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-md">
       <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-green-700">
         <CheckCircle2 className="h-5 w-5" />
         <p className="text-sm font-medium">
           No low-confidence rows found. All extractions are high-confidence!
         </p>
       </div>
     </div>
   )}
   ```

**Data Flow:**
- Confidence scores calculated in Story 2.3 extraction API (`app/api/extract/production/route.ts`)
- ExtractedRow interface includes `confidence: number` (0.0 to 1.0)
- Low-confidence threshold: 0.7 (defined in tech spec, implemented in Story 2.4)
- Filter applied client-side before rendering table rows
- Summary stats calculated from filtered/unfiltered datasets

**Focus for This Story:**
Given that implementation is complete, this story focuses on:
1. Comprehensive testing of all confidence review features
2. Edge case validation (0% low-confidence, 100% low-confidence, threshold boundary)
3. Documentation of confidence scoring methodology and review workflow
4. Performance testing with large datasets
5. User acceptance testing to validate 0.7 threshold appropriateness
6. Cross-browser and accessibility testing
7. Integration validation with related stories (2.4, upcoming 2.6)

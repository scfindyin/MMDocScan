# Story 3.3: Drag-and-Drop Field Reordering

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want to reorder extraction fields by dragging them,
So that I can organize fields in a logical sequence.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. @dnd-kit/core installed and configured
2. Field tags draggable with visual drag handle (⠿)
3. Dragging shows drop zones between other tags
4. Tags reorder on drop
5. Order persisted in template data structure
6. Keyboard navigation: Arrow up/down to reorder focused tag
7. Screen reader announces: "Drag to reorder, press enter to edit"
8. Smooth animation when reordering
9. Drag works on desktop and touch devices

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**@dnd-kit Library (from Tech Spec):**
- Use @dnd-kit/core for DndContext and sensors
- Use @dnd-kit/sortable for SortableContext and useSortable hook
- Use @dnd-kit/utilities for CSS utility functions
- Sensor configuration: MouseSensor, TouchSensor, KeyboardSensor
- Collision detection: closestCenter algorithm

**Component Integration:**
- Wrap FieldTagsArea with DndContext (parent provider)
- Wrap field list with SortableContext (sortable items container)
- Modify FieldTag to use useSortable hook
- Drag handle (⠿) should be the only drag trigger (not entire tag)

**Zustand Store:**
- Use existing reorderFields(startIndex, endIndex) action
- Action already implemented in Story 3.2 (stores/extractionStore.ts)
- Ensure isDirty flag set to true when fields reordered

**Accessibility Requirements (from Tech Spec AC14):**
- ARIA labels: "Drag to reorder, press enter to edit"
- Keyboard navigation: Arrow up/down to reorder
- Screen reader compatible
- Focus indicators visible (2px blue outline)

**Animation Requirements (from Tech Spec AC11.3):**
- Smooth transitions (300ms duration)
- No layout thrashing or scroll jank
- 60fps performance target
- CSS transform for position changes (not top/left)

**Touch Support:**
- TouchSensor configured in DndContext
- Long-press activates drag (avoid conflict with scroll)
- Test on mobile devices or Chrome DevTools emulator

### Project Structure Notes

**Modified Files:**
```
app/extract/components/FieldTagsArea.tsx (add DndContext, SortableContext)
app/extract/components/FieldTag.tsx (add useSortable hook, drag handle)
package.json (add @dnd-kit dependencies)
package-lock.json (auto-generated)
```

**Dependencies to Install:**
```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
```

**No New Components:**
- All changes in existing FieldTagsArea and FieldTag components

- [Source: Story 3.2 - FieldTag component with drag handle placeholder]
- [Source: Story 3.2 - stores/extractionStore.ts reorderFields action]

### Integration Points

**Story 3.2 Dependencies:**
- FieldTag component already has drag handle icon (⠿) as placeholder
- reorderFields action already exists in extractionStore
- Field order property already tracked in ExtractionField interface

**Story 3.4 Integration:**
- Reordered fields will be saved to database via Story 3.5 (Save Template)
- Order property persisted in template_fields.display_order column

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing functionality from Story 3.2 preserved
- Drag handle becomes functional (was visual-only)
- Field editing, deletion, and validation unchanged

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**

Successfully implemented drag-and-drop field reordering using @dnd-kit libraries with all 9 acceptance criteria met:

1. **@dnd-kit Installation (AC1):** Installed @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, and @dnd-kit/utilities packages via npm.

2. **DndContext Configuration (AC1-4):** Modified FieldTagsArea.tsx to wrap field tags with DndContext provider, configured sensors (PointerSensor, TouchSensor, KeyboardSensor), implemented closestCenter collision detection, and added onDragEnd handler to reorder fields using the existing reorderFields Zustand action.

3. **Sortable Field Tags (AC2-4):** Modified FieldTag.tsx to use useSortable hook, applied transform/transition CSS styles for smooth 300ms animations with opacity feedback during drag, and configured drag handle (⠿) as the only drag trigger (attributes/listeners applied to handle only).

4. **Keyboard Navigation (AC6-7):** KeyboardSensor enabled for arrow up/down navigation. Added ARIA label "Drag to reorder, press enter to edit" for screen reader accessibility.

5. **Touch Support (AC9):** TouchSensor configured with 200ms long-press activation constraint to avoid conflicts with scrolling.

6. **Zustand Integration (AC5):** Used existing reorderFields action from extractionStore. isDirty flag automatically set to true when fields reordered.

7. **Visual Feedback (AC3, AC8):** Implemented smooth animations with 300ms transitions, opacity change during drag (0.5), and z-index elevation. @dnd-kit handles drop zone indicators automatically.

8. **Build/Lint Validation:** Build passed with zero TypeScript errors. Lint passed with zero ESLint warnings.

**Technical Approach:**

- Used verticalListSortingStrategy from @dnd-kit/sortable for proper vertical list behavior
- PointerSensor with 8px activation distance prevents accidental drags on clicks
- TouchSensor with 200ms delay ensures long-press activation on mobile
- Transform/transition applied via inline styles for optimal performance (CSS transform, not top/left)
- Drag handle onClick event stops propagation to prevent triggering edit modal during drag

**All acceptance criteria verified and passing.**

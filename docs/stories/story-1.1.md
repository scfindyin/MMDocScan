# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with React Server Components architecture
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3.4+ utility-first framework
- **UI Components:** ShadCN (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- **Deployment:** Vercel serverless platform with automatic CI/CD

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Use Next.js App Router (app directory structure) instead of Pages Router
- Implement React Server Components as default (mark client components explicitly with 'use client')
- Follow ShadCN copy-paste component pattern (components owned in codebase, not npm dependencies)
- Minimize bundle size from the start to stay within Vercel free tier bandwidth limits

**Constraints:**
- Level 2 project complexity: Simple architecture, minimal abstraction, prioritize speed
- Cost optimization: Design must stay within Vercel free tier (100GB bandwidth/month)
- Browser compatibility: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- No authentication required for MVP (single-user internal tool)

### Testing Standards Summary

**Testing Approach for this Story:**
- **Manual Verification:** Visual inspection of deployed application
- **Smoke Tests:**
  - Homepage loads without errors (200 status)
  - Navigation renders correctly
  - Tailwind styles apply (test utility class)
  - ShadCN component renders (install test button)
  - Development server starts without errors
  - Production build completes successfully

**Future Testing Setup (deferred to later stories):**
- Unit testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E testing: Playwright
- Coverage target: 70%+ for critical paths

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**

This story establishes the foundational project structure following Next.js 14 conventions with App Router:

- `/app` directory for routes and layouts (Next.js 14 standard)
- `/components` directory for reusable UI components
- `/components/ui` for ShadCN components (copy-paste pattern)
- `/lib` for shared utilities and helper functions
- Root-level configuration files (tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)

**No Conflicts Detected:**
- First story in the project, establishing baseline structure
- Following Next.js 14 best practices and ShadCN conventions
- Structure supports future features (API routes, database integration)

**Rationale for Structure:**
- Next.js App Router enables React Server Components (better performance)
- ShadCN copy-paste pattern gives full component control (no npm bloat)
- Separation of UI components (`/components/ui`) from feature components (`/components`) enables clear organization

### Debug Log References

Implementation completed in single session with continuous execution following dev-story workflow. All tasks completed sequentially without blockers.

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Approach:**
- Created Next.js 14.2.33 project with TypeScript 5.3+ from scratch (manual setup due to package naming constraints)

- Installed ShadCN Button component with Radix UI primitives to verify component library integration
- Built responsive navigation component with MMDocScan branding and placeholder links (Templates, Process Documents)
- Initialized Git repository with comprehensive commit message for Vercel deployment
- Created README with deployment instructions and local development setup guide

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Next.js App Router (app directory) for React Server Components support
- Configured strict TypeScript mode for type safety
- Applied ShadCN copy-paste pattern (components owned in codebase vs npm dependencies)
- Set Vercel region to iad1 (US East) for optimal performance

**Verification:**

- Production build size: 87.2 kB First Load JS (well within Vercel free tier limits)
- ESLint: 0 warnings, 0 errors
- Build time: ~5-7 seconds
- Dev server startup: 2 seconds

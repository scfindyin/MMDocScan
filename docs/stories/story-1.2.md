## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Technology Stack:**
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (managed cloud database)
- **Database Client:** @supabase/supabase-js SDK (version ^2.38.0)
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (serverless functions on Vercel)
- **Authentication:** Supabase anon key (public access for MVP, no user auth required)

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Use Supabase for PostgreSQL database hosting (eliminates need for self-managed database infrastructure)
- Implement Supabase client as singleton utility in /lib directory for consistent reuse
- Store only templates in database for MVP (no document persistence - documents processed in-memory only)
- Use environment variables for credentials (never commit secrets to repository)
- Leverage Next.js API routes for database interaction (serverless architecture)

**Constraints:**
- **Supabase Free Tier Limits:** 500MB database storage, 2GB bandwidth/month, 50MB file upload limit
- **Level 2 Project Complexity:** Simple architecture - direct Supabase client usage (no ORM abstraction needed)
- **Cost Optimization:** Stay within free tier as long as possible; optimize queries and minimize data transfer
- **Security:** Use anon key for public access (MVP is single-user internal tool, no authentication required)

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Files to Create:**
```
/
├── lib/
│   └── supabase.ts              (Supabase client initialization)
├── app/
│   └── api/
│       └── db-test/
│           └── route.ts         (Database connection test endpoint)
├── .env.local                   (Local environment variables - DO NOT COMMIT)
├── .env.example                 (Example environment variables for documentation)
└── README.md                    (Update with environment setup instructions)
```

**Files to Modify:**
- package.json (add @supabase/supabase-js dependency)
- .gitignore (ensure .env.local is excluded - should already be present from Story 1.1)
- README.md (add Supabase setup section)

**Database Schema (Future Story 1.3):**
- This story establishes connection only
- Database schema (templates table) will be created in Story 1.3
- No migrations or table creation in this story

[Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-combined.md#Data Models and Contracts]

### Testing Standards Summary

**Testing Approach for this Story:**
- **Manual Verification:** Primary testing method for database connection
- **Connection Tests:**
  - Local development: /api/db-test endpoint returns successful connection status
  - Vercel deployment: /api/db-test endpoint accessible and returns success
  - Error handling: Invalid credentials produce user-friendly error messages
  - No secrets exposed in error responses or logs

**Test Queries:**
- Simple SELECT query (e.g., `SELECT current_timestamp`) to verify connection
- No data modification in this story (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE deferred to Story 1.3)

**Future Testing Setup:**
- Unit tests for Supabase client initialization (deferred to later stories)
- Integration tests with test database (deferred to later stories)
- Error simulation tests for connection failures

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**

This story extends the foundation from Story 1.1 by adding database connectivity:

- `/lib` directory for shared utilities (established in Story 1.1) - adding Supabase client singleton
- `/app/api` directory for API routes (new in this story) - Next.js serverless function convention
- Environment variables pattern following Next.js best practices (.env.local for local, Vercel UI for deployment)

**No Conflicts Detected:**
- Extends existing structure without modifying Story 1.1 components
- API routes directory is standard Next.js 14 App Router convention
- Supabase client in /lib follows established pattern for shared utilities

**Rationale for Structure:**
- Singleton Supabase client pattern prevents multiple connection instances (performance optimization)
- Environment variables provide security and flexibility (different credentials for dev/staging/production)
- API route for testing enables verification without frontend dependency

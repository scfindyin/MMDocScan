# Story 3.1: Unified Page Layout with Resizable Panels

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a user,
I want a single-page interface with resizable left and right panels,
So that I can configure extraction settings and view results without losing context.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New `/extract` route created with App Router
2. Page layout with left panel (configuration) and right panel (results)
3. Panels resizable via draggable divider using react-resizable-panels
4. Default: Left panel 300px, right panel fluid
5. Min widths: Left 250px, Right 600px
6. Panel sizes persist to localStorage
7. Maximize button on left panel → right minimizes to thin bar
8. Maximize button on right panel → left minimizes to thin bar
9. Click minimized bar to restore panel
10. Smooth resize animations

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with existing structure:**
- New route follows App Router pattern from Epic 1 (app/templates/, app/process/)
- Component organization: Create components/extract/ subdirectory for extract-specific components
- State management: New approach with Zustand (Epic 1-2 used component state)
- Styling: Continue using Tailwind CSS classes consistent with existing pages

**Expected file tree:**
```
app/
  extract/
    page.tsx          # New route (server component)
    ExtractPage.tsx   # Client component with panels
stores/
  extractionStore.ts  # Zustand store (new pattern for Epic 3)
components/
  extract/            # New directory for extract-specific components
    ResizableLayout.tsx   # Wrapper for panel logic
    LeftPanel.tsx      # Configuration panel
    RightPanel.tsx     # Results panel
```

### Architecture Constraints

**From Tech Spec Epic 3:**
- **State Management:** Zustand replaces component-level state for global extraction workflow (Section: System Architecture Alignment → New Architectural Components)
- **Resizable UI:** react-resizable-panels for draggable divider and maximize/minimize (Dependencies table: +15KB bundle impact)
- **Performance Targets:** Page load <2s (from NFR → Performance table)
- **Bundle Size:** Total bundle for /extract route target <200KB gzipped

**Integration with existing architecture:**
- Reuses Next.js 14 App Router (Stories 1.1-2.9 foundation)
- Maintains Tailwind CSS styling consistency
- Uses ShadCN components for buttons and cards where applicable
- No changes to database schema in this story (database changes in Story 3.11)

### Technical Decisions

**1. Panel Size Storage: localStorage vs. Database**
- Decision: localStorage (per Tech Spec Q7 resolution)
- Rationale: Simple implementation, no DB overhead, sufficient for MVP
- Future: Database sync deferred to Phase 2.0 if cross-device consistency requested

**2. State Management: Zustand vs. React Context**
- Decision: Zustand (per Tech Spec Section: New Architectural Components)
- Rationale: Simpler API than Context, DevTools support, scales to Epic 3 complexity
- Implementation: Create extractionStore.ts with panel state slices

**3. Min Width Strategy: Pixels vs. Percentage**
- Decision: Percentage-based constraints (25% left, 60% right) with px documentation
- Rationale: Better responsive behavior, react-resizable-panels uses percentages internally
- Note: Document px equivalents in comments (25% ≈ 250px at 1000px viewport)

### Implementation Guidance

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - Install dependencies (Task 1-2)
   - Create store structure before components
   - Reference Zustand docs: https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction

2. **Layout Phase:**
   - Start with minimal page.tsx (Task 3)
   - Build ResizablePanelGroup incrementally (Task 4)
   - Test resize behavior before adding persistence

3. **Enhancement Phase:**
   - Add localStorage persistence (Task 5)
   - Implement maximize/minimize (Task 6)
   - Polish animations (Task 7)

4. **Polish Phase:**
   - Add placeholder content (Task 8)
   - Test responsive behavior (Task 9)
   - Run full validation suite (Task 10)

**Key code patterns:**

```typescript
// Zustand store structure
interface ExtractionStore {
  // Panel state
  leftPanelSize: number      // 0-100 percentage
  rightPanelSize: number     // 0-100 percentage
  isLeftMaximized: boolean
  isRightMaximized: boolean

  // Actions
  setPanelSizes: (left: number, right: number) => void
  maximizeLeft: () => void
  maximizeRight: () => void
  restoreLeft: () => void
  restoreRight: () => void
}

// Component usage
<PanelGroup direction="horizontal">
  <Panel defaultSize={30} minSize={25}>
    {/* Left panel content */}
  </Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel defaultSize={70} minSize={60}>
    {/* Right panel content */}
  </Panel>
</PanelGroup>
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Zustand store actions (setPanelSizes, maximize/minimize logic)
- localStorage persistence utilities

**Integration Tests:**
- Panel resize behavior with constraints
- Maximize/minimize state changes
- localStorage save/load cycle

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**
- Full user journey: Drag divider → maximize → refresh → verify persistence
- Test case from Tech Spec Test Strategy (Section: E2E Tests)

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [x] Drag divider smoothly left and right
- [x] Hit min width constraints (left 25%, right 60%)
- [x] Maximize left panel, verify right minimizes to thin bar
- [x] Click thin bar, verify right panel restores
- [x] Maximize right panel, verify left minimizes to thin bar
- [x] Refresh page, verify panel sizes persist
- [x] Test on tablet (768px) and mobile (375px) viewports

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Dependencies installed first (react-resizable-panels ^2.0.0, zustand ^4.5.0)
2. Zustand store created with persist middleware for localStorage integration
3. Single-file client component approach (ExtractPageClient.tsx) with all panel logic
4. Panel states: normal, left-maximized (right thin bar), right-maximized (left thin bar)
5. CSS transitions applied via Tailwind classes for smooth 300ms animations
6. Responsive design achieved through percentage-based minSize constraints

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Zustand persist middleware instead of custom localStorage hook (cleaner API)
- Single client component instead of separate LeftPanel/RightPanel components (simpler for this story, can refactor in 3.2)
- Collapsible prop enabled on Panels for better UX when minimized
- Vertical text rendering for thin bar labels using CSS writing-mode

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
- ✅ All 10 acceptance criteria implemented and verified
- ✅ All 10 tasks completed (42 subtasks total)
- ✅ Build successful: 0 errors, /extract route 16.3 kB (112 kB First Load JS)
- ✅ Lint successful: 0 warnings
- ✅ Bundle size: Well under 200KB target (112 kB vs 200 kB target)
- ✅ Panel persistence working via Zustand persist middleware
- ✅ Maximize/minimize controls fully functional with state management
- ✅ Smooth animations via CSS transitions (300ms ease-in-out)
- ✅ Placeholder content ready for Stories 3.2 and 3.7

**Integration Points:**
- Navigation updated with "Batch Extract" link
- Ready for Story 3.2 (Tag-Based Template Builder) - left panel prepared
- Ready for Story 3.7 (Basic Extraction with Results Table) - right panel prepared
- Zustand store architecture established for Epic 3 state management

**Responsive Design:**
- Desktop (1280px+): Full two-panel layout with draggable divider
- Tablet (768px): Panels maintain functionality, min constraints adapt
- Mobile (375px): Percentage-based constraints ensure panels remain functional (may need vertical stacking in future story if UX testing shows issues)

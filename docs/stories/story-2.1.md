## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Page Architecture:**
- Next.js 14 App Router pattern: `/app/process/page.tsx`
- Client component (file upload requires browser APIs)
- Follows existing pattern from template creation workflow (Story 1.6)

**File Handling Strategy:**
- Files stored in React state as native File objects (in-memory only)
- No immediate base64 conversion (deferred to Story 2.3 when extraction API is called)
- No server-side upload or persistence - files remain in browser memory
- Files cleared from state after export or page navigation

**Validation Architecture:**
- Client-side validation only (file type, size) via react-dropzone
- Server-side validation not needed (no file uploads to server in this story)

**Navigation Flow:**
- Process Documents page is entry point for production workflow
- Distinct from Template Builder workflow (different route: `/process` vs `/templates/new`)
- Next button leads to template selection (Story 2.2 - not implemented yet)

### Source Tree Components

**New Files to Create:**
- `app/process/page.tsx` - Main production document processing page (this story: upload interface only)

**Files to Modify:**
- `components/Navigation.tsx` - Add "Process Documents" link

**Dependencies:**
- react-dropzone (already installed in Story 1.6, version ^14.3.5)
- ShadCN components: Button, Card, Alert (already installed)
- lucide-react icons: Upload, FileText, File, X, ArrowRight

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Testing (Deferred to Story 2.3):**
- File upload state management
- Validation logic (file type, size)

**Integration Testing:**
- Full upload workflow: drag-and-drop → display → remove → re-upload
- File picker workflow: click → select → display
- Error handling: oversized file, unsupported type

**Manual Testing:**
- Cross-browser drag-and-drop functionality
- Cross-browser file picker
- Responsive layout on desktop and tablet

**Acceptance Criteria Validation:**
- AC1: Navigation link present and functional
- AC2: Page displays correctly with upload interface
- AC3: Both drag-and-drop and file picker functional
- AC4: PDF, Word, text files accepted
- AC5: 10MB limit enforced with error message
- AC6: File info (name, type, size) displays correctly
- AC7: Remove button clears file and allows re-upload
- AC8: Clear visual distinction from template creation
- AC9: "Next" button enabled only when file uploaded

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- New route: `/app/process/page.tsx` follows App Router conventions
- Consistent with existing `/app/templates/` structure
- Uses established component library (ShadCN) and styling (Tailwind)

**No Conflicts Detected:**
- No overlap with template creation functionality
- Separate route prevents navigation confusion
- Reuses established patterns (file upload from Story 1.6)

**Previous Story Context:**
- Story 1.6: Sample Document Upload for Template Creation - established react-dropzone pattern, file upload UI, validation logic
- Story 1.4: Template List and Management UI - established navigation patterns with ShadCN components

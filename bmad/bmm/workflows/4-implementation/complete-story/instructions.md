# Complete Story Workflow Instructions

## Purpose
Automate the full story lifecycle from creation to implementation, testing, and GitHub push. This workflow orchestrates multiple agents and workflows to complete a user story end-to-end with minimal manual intervention.

## What This Workflow Does

### **Phase 1: Story Creation & Review**
1. **SM Agent** creates draft story using `create-story` workflow
2. **Architect Agent** reviews for technical feasibility and alignment
3. **If issues found:** SM Agent regenerates story with fixes (max 2 iterations)
4. **If approved:** Continue to Phase 2

### **Phase 2: Preparation**
5. **SM Agent** marks story as Ready for Development (`story-ready` workflow)
6. **SM Agent** generates Story Context XML (`story-context` workflow)

### **Phase 3: Implementation**
7. **Dev Agent** implements all tasks (`dev-story` workflow)
8. **SM Agent** tests database operations via Supabase MCP (if applicable)

### **Phase 4: Finalization**
9. **Dev Agent** pushes changes to GitHub with auto-generated commit message
10. **SM Agent** generates completion report with next steps

## When to Use This Workflow

**‚úÖ Use complete-story when:**
- You want full automation from story creation to GitHub push
- The story is well-defined in epics.md with clear requirements
- You have Supabase MCP configured for database testing
- You want minimal manual intervention

**‚ùå Don't use complete-story when:**
- Story requirements are ambiguous (use `create-story` manually first)
- You want to review architect feedback before regenerating
- Implementation requires manual testing beyond database operations
- Story involves complex infrastructure changes requiring human oversight

## Execution Steps

### **Step 1: Load Workflow Configuration**

```bash
# Load this workflow file
workflow_file = "{project-root}/bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/complete-story/workflow.yaml"
```

### **Step 2: Discover Next Story**

```bash
# Read workflow-status to determine next story
workflow_status_file = "{output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md"

# Extract:
# - TODO_STORY: Next story to work on (e.g., "3.5")
# - IN_PROGRESS_STORY: Current story (should be empty or completed)
# - Epic number and story number
```

### **Step 3: Spawn SM Agent for Story Creation**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `create-story` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Epic number (from workflow-status)
- Story number (from workflow-status)
- Non-interactive mode: `true`

**Expected Output:**
- Story file created at `{story_dir}/story-{epic_num}.{story_num}.md`
- Story status: Draft

### **Step 4: Spawn Architect Agent for Review**

**Agent:** `architect-reviewer`
**Task:** Review story for technical feasibility
**Inputs:**
- Story file path (from Step 3)
- Tech spec file (e.g., `tech-spec-epic-{epic_num}.md`)
- Epics file (`epics.md`)

**Expected Output:**
- Review verdict: `APPROVED` or `REQUIRES CHANGES`
- List of issues (if any)
- List of recommendations

### **Step 5: Conditional - Regenerate Story (if needed)**

**Condition:** Architect verdict == `REQUIRES CHANGES`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `create-story` workflow WITH architect feedback
**Inputs:**
- Architect feedback (from Step 4)
- Same epic/story numbers
- Overwrite existing story file

**Max Iterations:** 2
**After max iterations:** Prompt user for manual intervention

**Loop:** Return to Step 4 for architect re-review

### **Step 6: Mark Story Ready**

**Condition:** Architect verdict == `APPROVED`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `story-ready` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path (from Step 3 or Step 5)

**Expected Output:**
- Story status updated to: Ready
- Workflow-status updated

### **Step 7: Generate Story Context**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `story-context` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path

**Expected Output:**
- Story Context XML created at `{story_dir}/story-context-{epic_num}.{story_num}.xml`

### **Step 8: Implement Story**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Execute `dev-story` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path
- Story Context XML path

**Expected Output:**
- List of files created
- List of files modified
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Implementation status: `completed` or `blocked`

**On Failure:**
- Generate error report
- Abort workflow
- Notify user of blockers

### **Step 9: Test Database Operations (if applicable)**

**Condition:** Story involves database changes (check story tasks for migration/schema keywords)

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute database tests via Supabase MCP

**Test Coverage:**
1. **RLS Policies**
   - Create second test user
   - Test SELECT (user sees only own data)
   - Test INSERT (user creates for self only)
   - Test UPDATE (cross-user blocked)
   - Test DELETE (cross-user blocked)

2. **Migration Verification**
   - Execute migration SQL via `mcp__supabase__apply_migration`
   - Verify schema changes via `mcp__supabase__list_tables`
   - Check data integrity with sample queries

3. **Security Advisors**
   - Run `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` with type: `security`
   - Check for RLS disabled warnings
   - Verify no new critical issues

**Expected Output:**
- Test results: Pass/fail for each test
- Security advisor summary
- Data migration stats (rows affected, etc.)

**On Failure:**
- Report failed tests
- Continue to Step 10 (do not abort)

### **Step 10: Push to GitHub**

**Condition:** Implementation status == `completed` AND auto_push_to_github == `true`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Git commit and push

**Commit Message Format:**
```
Implement Story {epic_num}.{story_num}: {story_title}

{Summary of changes}

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Commands:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "{commit_message}"
git push
```

**On Failure:**
- Report git errors
- Continue to Step 11 (do not abort)
- User can manually push later

### **Step 11: Generate Completion Report**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Summarize workflow execution

**Report Sections:**
1. **Story Summary**
   - Story ID, title, status
   - Architect review iterations (if any)

2. **Implementation Summary**
   - Files created (count + list)
   - Files modified (count + list)
   - Tests run (count + results)

3. **Database Testing** (if applicable)
   - Migration status
   - RLS policy test results
   - Security advisor findings

4. **Git Status**
   - Commit hash (if pushed)
   - Push status (success/failed)

5. **Next Steps**
   - If all passed: "Run `*approve-story` workflow to complete Story {epic_num}.{story_num}"
   - If blocked: "Review errors and fix issues before approval"
   - If manual testing needed: "Perform manual testing, then run `*approve-story`"

**Output File:** `{output_folder}/complete-story-report-{epic_num}.{story_num}.md`

## Error Handling

### **Story Creation Fails**
- **Action:** Abort workflow
- **Reason:** Cannot proceed without story
- **User Action:** Check epics.md for valid story definition, re-run workflow

### **Architect Rejects After Max Iterations**
- **Action:** Pause workflow, prompt user
- **Reason:** Story has fundamental issues requiring human review
- **User Action:** Manually review architect feedback, edit story, re-run from Step 2

### **Implementation Blocked**
- **Action:** Abort workflow, generate report
- **Reason:** Dev agent encountered errors or missing dependencies
- **User Action:** Review implementation errors, fix blockers, re-run `dev-story` workflow

### **Database Tests Fail**
- **Action:** Report failures, continue to GitHub push
- **Reason:** Tests may fail due to environment issues, not blocking
- **User Action:** Review test failures, fix database issues, re-test manually

### **Git Push Fails**
- **Action:** Report error, continue to completion report
- **Reason:** Git errors (conflicts, auth issues) don't invalidate implementation
- **User Action:** Manually resolve git issues and push

## Example Execution

### **Scenario:** Complete Story 3.5 from scratch

```yaml
# User runs: *complete-story

# Workflow execution:
Step 1: SM creates story-3.5.md (Draft)
  ‚úÖ Story file: docs/stories/story-3.5.md
  ‚úÖ Status: Draft

Step 2: Architect reviews story-3.5.md
  ‚ùå Verdict: REQUIRES CHANGES
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues: 3 critical issues found

Step 3: SM regenerates story-3.5.md with architect feedback
  ‚úÖ Story file: docs/stories/story-3.5.md (overwritten)
  ‚úÖ Status: Draft v2

Step 2 (iteration 2): Architect re-reviews story-3.5.md
  ‚úÖ Verdict: APPROVED
  ‚úÖ All issues resolved

Step 4: SM marks story-3.5.md as Ready
  ‚úÖ Status: Ready
  ‚úÖ Workflow-status updated

Step 5: SM generates story-context-3.5.xml
  ‚úÖ Context file: docs/stories/story-context-3.5.xml (279 lines)

Step 6: Dev implements story-3.5
  ‚úÖ Files created: 5
  ‚úÖ Files modified: 8
  ‚úÖ Build passed
  ‚úÖ Status: completed

Step 7: SM tests database operations
  ‚úÖ Migration executed
  ‚úÖ RLS policies tested (all passed)
  ‚úÖ Security advisors: 0 new issues

Step 8: Dev pushes to GitHub
  ‚úÖ Commit: a1b2c3d "Implement Story 3.5: Save Template Flow"
  ‚úÖ Pushed to origin/main

Step 9: SM generates completion report
  ‚úÖ Report: docs/complete-story-report-3.5.md
  ‚úÖ Next action: Run *approve-story workflow

# Total time: ~15 minutes (fully automated)
```

## Troubleshooting

### **"No story found in workflow-status"**
- **Solution:** Check `TODO_STORY` field in workflow-status.md is populated

### **"Architect keeps rejecting story"**
- **Solution:** After 2 iterations, manually review epics.md and tech spec for clarity

### **"Dev agent reports blockers"**
- **Solution:** Check implementation errors, install missing dependencies, re-run workflow

### **"Database tests fail"**
- **Solution:** Verify Supabase MCP connection, check migration SQL syntax

### **"Git push fails with conflicts"**
- **Solution:** Pull latest changes, resolve conflicts, manually push

---

## Success Criteria

**Workflow is successful if:**
1. ‚úÖ Story created and approved by architect
2. ‚úÖ Story marked as Ready
3. ‚úÖ Implementation completed with no blockers
4. ‚úÖ Database tests passed (if applicable)
5. ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub
6. ‚úÖ Completion report generated

**Partial success if:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation completed but database tests failed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation completed but git push failed

**Failure if:**
- ‚ùå Story creation failed
- ‚ùå Architect rejected after max iterations
- ‚ùå Implementation blocked with errors

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Improvements:**
1. **Frontend Testing:** Add Playwright tests for UI changes
2. **Performance Testing:** Benchmark API endpoints before/after
3. **Security Scanning:** Integrate OWASP dependency check
4. **Deployment:** Auto-deploy to staging after successful tests
5. **Notifications:** Slack/email alerts on workflow completion
6. **Rollback:** Auto-rollback if production tests fail

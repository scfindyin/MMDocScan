# Complete Story Workflow Instructions

## Purpose
Automate the full story lifecycle from creation to implementation, testing, and GitHub push. This workflow is orchestrated by the **SM (Scrum Master)** agent who coordinates multiple sub-agents while preserving context and minimizing duplicate file reads.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION POLICY

**üö® CONTINUOUS EXECUTION REQUIRED:**
- This workflow MUST run **Steps 1-11 without interruption**
- **DO NOT** pause mid-workflow to ask user if they want to continue
- **DO NOT** stop after Step 6 asking "What would you like to do?"
- **RUN ALL STEPS AUTOMATICALLY** from start to finish
- **ONLY pause at Step 11** (completion report) for user to manually test features
- **Purpose:** Minimize interruptions - work shouldn't pause waiting for approval between steps - the exception to this is if an issue arises that warrants my intevention

**User Interaction Points:**
- ‚úÖ **Before workflow:** User triggers `*complete-story` command
- ‚ùå **During workflow:** NO user input required (Steps 1-11 run automatically)
- ‚úÖ **After workflow:** User manually tests features, then runs `*complete-story` again for next story

## SM Agent Orchestration with Context Optimization
This workflow is executed by the **SM (Scrum Master)** agent, which:
1. **Pre-loads common documents ONCE** (config, epics, PRD, tech spec, workflow-status, solution-architecture)
2. **Maintains documents in memory** throughout the workflow execution
3. **Spawns sub-agents using Task tool** for specialized work (Architect review, Dev implementation)
4. **Passes document context** to each sub-agent by including full content in prompt text
5. **Eliminates duplicate file reads** (80% reduction in file I/O operations)
6. **Preserves context across agents** (faster execution, lower token usage)

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR SM ORCHESTRATOR:**
When instructions say "Spawn X agent", you MUST:
- Use the Task tool to spawn the specialized agent
- Include pre-loaded document content in the agent's prompt parameter
- Instruct the agent "DO NOT read these files - they are provided above in your context"
- Wait for agent completion before proceeding to next step

**Efficiency Gains:**
- **Before (without context-manager):** ~34+ file reads with duplicates across agents
- **After (with context-manager):** ~6 file reads total (80% reduction)
- **Token savings:** ~50k+ tokens across 6+ agent spawns
- **Time savings:** 6-12 seconds eliminated from file search and duplicate reads. Also, this eliminates all the time wasted when agents are waiting for my response to continue work

## What This Workflow Does

### **Phase 0: Cleanup (Conditional)**
1. **Dev Agent** approves previous story (if exists) - marks Done, advances queue (`story-approved` workflow)

### **Phase 1: Story Creation & Review**
2. **SM Agent** creates draft story using `create-story` workflow
3. **Architect Agent** reviews for technical feasibility and alignment
4. **If issues found:** SM Agent regenerates story with fixes (max 3 iterations)
5. **If approved:** Continue to Phase 2

### **Phase 2: Preparation**
6. **SM Agent** marks story as Ready for Development (`story-ready` workflow)
7. **SM Agent** generates Story Context XML (`story-context` workflow)

### **Phase 3: Implementation & Verification**
8. **Dev Agent** implements all tasks (`dev-story` workflow)
9. **Dev Agent** runs build verification (`npm run build`) and fixes any errors
10. **SM Agent** tests database operations via Supabase MCP (if applicable)

### **Phase 4: Finalization**
11. **Dev Agent** pushes changes to GitHub with auto-generated commit message (only if build succeeds)
12. **SM Agent** generates completion report with next steps

## When to Use This Workflow

**‚úÖ Use complete-story when:**
- You want full automation from story creation to GitHub push
- The story is well-defined in epics.md with clear requirements
- You have Supabase MCP configured for database testing
- You want minimal manual intervention

**‚ùå Don't use complete-story when:**
- Story requirements are ambiguous (use `create-story` manually first)
- You want to review architect feedback before regenerating
- Implementation requires manual testing beyond database operations
- Story involves complex infrastructure changes requiring human oversight

---

## Execution Steps

### **Step 0: Context-Manager Initialization (CRITICAL)**

**üö® EXECUTION MODE: FULLY AUTOMATED**
- Execute Steps 1-11 **continuously without stopping**
- **DO NOT pause** to ask user questions between steps
- **DO NOT offer options** like "What would you like to do next?"
- Only user interaction: Final completion report (Step 11) for manual testing

**BEFORE executing any sub-agents, the context-manager MUST:**

1. **Load all documents from `context_documents` section:**
   ```yaml
   # Required documents (load first)
   - config: "{project-root}/bmad/bmm/config.yaml"
   - epics: "{output_folder}/epics.md"
   - prd: "{output_folder}/PRD.md"
   - workflow_status: "{output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md"

   # Optional documents (load if exists)
   - solution_architecture: "{output_folder}/solution-architecture.md"

   # Dynamic documents (discover based on workflow-status)
   - tech_spec: "{output_folder}/tech-spec-epic-{epic_num}.md"
     (where epic_num is extracted from workflow_status TODO_STORY or IN_PROGRESS_STORY)
   ```

2. **Extract session variables from config:**
   ```yaml
   user_name: from config.yaml
   communication_language: from config.yaml
   output_folder: from config.yaml
   dev_story_location: from config.yaml
   ```

3. **Store all documents in context-manager memory:**
   - Documents are now loaded ONCE
   - Will be automatically available to ALL sub-agents
   - No sub-agent needs to read these files again
   - Context-manager maintains this state throughout entire workflow

**Token Efficiency:**
- Documents loaded: ~6 files (~15k-20k tokens total)
- Documents in context-manager memory: Cached for all agents
- Estimated savings: ~50k+ tokens across 6+ agent spawns (SM √ó 3, Architect √ó 2, Dev √ó 1)
- Each agent receives pre-loaded context automatically

---

### **Step 1: Approve Previous Story (Conditional)**

**Condition:** workflow-status has `IN_PROGRESS_STORY` populated

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Execute `story-approved` workflow

**Purpose:** Before starting the next story, mark the previous story (that you just tested) as Done and advance the story queue.

**Process:**
1. **Check for IN_PROGRESS story in workflow-status** (already loaded in context-manager memory)
2. **If IN_PROGRESS_STORY exists:**
   - Read the story file at `{story_dir}/{in_progress_story_file}`
   - Update story status from "Ready" OR "Implemented" ‚Üí "Done"
   - Add completion notes with date to Dev Agent Record section
   - Invoke `workflow-status` update action `complete_story`:
     - Move IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí DONE
     - Move TODO ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS
     - Move BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO
3. **If no IN_PROGRESS_STORY:**
   - Skip this step (first story in sequence)

**Expected Output:**
- Previous story marked Done
- Story queue advanced
- Next story moved to IN_PROGRESS (becomes the story to create in Step 2)

**On Failure:** Abort workflow (cannot proceed without clean queue state)

**Workflow Benefit:** Maintains clean story lifecycle - test ‚Üí approve ‚Üí next story creation

---

### **Step 2: Load Workflow Configuration**

```bash
# Load this workflow file
workflow_file = "{project-root}/bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/complete-story/workflow.yaml"
```

### **Step 3: Discover Next Story**

**Context-manager reads workflow-status from memory (already loaded in Step 0):**
```bash
# No file read needed - workflow_status already in context
# Extract:
# - TODO_STORY: Next story to work on (e.g., "3.5")
# - IN_PROGRESS_STORY: Current story (should be empty or completed)
# - Epic number and story number
```

### **Step 4: Spawn SM Agent for Story Creation**

**CRITICAL:** Context-manager MUST use the Task tool to spawn the SM agent. Do not just describe what should happen - **actually execute the Task tool call**.

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `create-story` workflow
**How to Execute:**
```
Use Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Create Story {epic_num}.{story_num}"
- prompt: Include pre-loaded context (epics, PRD, tech_spec, workflow-status, config) in the prompt text
```

**Inputs:**
- Epic number (from workflow-status in context)
- Story number (from workflow-status in context - advanced by Step 1 if previous story existed)
- Non-interactive mode: `true`
- **Context passed in prompt:** epics, PRD, tech_spec, solution_architecture (from context-manager memory)

**Expected Output:**
- Story file created at `{story_dir}/story-{epic_num}.{story_num}.md`
- Story status: Draft

**Note:** SM agent receives pre-loaded documents via prompt text - no file reads needed!

### **Step 5: Spawn Architect Agent for Review**

**CRITICAL:** Context-manager MUST use the Task tool to spawn the architect-reviewer agent.

**Agent:** `architect-reviewer`
**Task:** Review story for technical feasibility
**How to Execute:**
```
Use Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "architect-reviewer"
- description: "Review Story {epic_num}.{story_num}"
- prompt: Include story file path and pre-loaded context in prompt
```

**Inputs:**
- Story file path (from Step 4)
- **Context passed in prompt:** tech_spec, epics, solution_architecture (from context-manager memory)

**Expected Output:**
- Review verdict: `APPROVED` or `REQUIRES CHANGES`
- List of issues (if any)
- List of recommendations

**Note:** Architect agent receives pre-loaded documents via prompt - no duplicate file reads!

### **Step 6: Conditional - Regenerate Story (if needed)**

**Condition:** Architect verdict == `REQUIRES CHANGES`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `create-story` workflow WITH architect feedback
**Inputs:**
- Architect feedback (from Step 5)
- Same epic/story numbers
- Overwrite existing story file

**Max Iterations:** 2
**After max iterations:** Prompt user for manual intervention

**Loop:** Return to Step 5 for architect re-review

### **Step 7: Mark Story Ready**

**Condition:** Architect verdict == `APPROVED`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `story-ready` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path (from Step 4 or Step 6)

**Expected Output:**
- Story status updated to: Ready
- Workflow-status updated

### **Step 8: Generate Story Context**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute `story-context` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path

**Expected Output:**
- Story Context XML created at `{story_dir}/story-context-{epic_num}.{story_num}.xml`

### **Step 9: Implement Story**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Execute `dev-story` workflow
**Inputs:**
- Story file path
- Story Context XML path

**Expected Output:**
- List of files created
- List of files modified
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Implementation status: `completed` or `blocked`

**On Failure:**
- Generate error report
- Abort workflow
- Notify user of blockers

### **Step 10: Build Verification (CRITICAL)**

**Condition:** Step 9 status == `completed`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Run local build and fix any errors before git push

**Build Process:**
1. **Run build command:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **If build succeeds:**
   - Capture build output
   - Proceed to Step 10 (Database Testing) or Step 11 (Git Push)

3. **If build fails:**
   - Capture all TypeScript/build errors
   - Analyze each error (type mismatches, missing imports, etc.)
   - Fix errors systematically:
     - Update type definitions
     - Fix property name mismatches (e.g., field_name ‚Üí name)
     - Add missing imports
     - Resolve any schema compatibility issues
   - Re-run build
   - Repeat until build succeeds (max 3 attempts)

**Expected Output:**
- Build status: `success` or `failed`
- Build errors: List of errors if any
- Fixes applied: List of fixes if errors were found

**On Failure (after max retries):**
- Report all unresolved build errors
- Abort workflow (DO NOT proceed to git push)
- Generate detailed error report for manual intervention

**CRITICAL:** Never push code that doesn't build. This step is mandatory before git operations.

### **Step 11: Test Database Operations (if applicable)**

**Condition:** Story involves database changes (check story tasks for migration/schema keywords)

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Execute database tests via Supabase MCP

**Test Coverage:**
1. **RLS Policies**
   - Create second test user
   - Test SELECT (user sees only own data)
   - Test INSERT (user creates for self only)
   - Test UPDATE (cross-user blocked)
   - Test DELETE (cross-user blocked)

2. **Migration Verification**
   - Execute migration SQL via `mcp__supabase__apply_migration`
   - Verify schema changes via `mcp__supabase__list_tables`
   - Check data integrity with sample queries

3. **Security Advisors**
   - Run `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` with type: `security`
   - Check for RLS disabled warnings
   - Verify no new critical issues

**Expected Output:**
- Test results: Pass/fail for each test
- Security advisor summary
- Data migration stats (rows affected, etc.)

**On Failure:**
- Report failed tests
- Continue to Step 11 (do not abort)

### **Step 12: Push to GitHub**

**Condition:** Step 10 build_status == `success` AND auto_push_to_github == `true`

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as Dev)
**Task:** Git commit and push

**Commit Message Format:**
```
Implement Story {epic_num}.{story_num}: {story_title}

{Summary of changes}

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Commands:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "{commit_message}"
git push
```

**After Successful Push:**
- Update story file status from "Ready" ‚Üí "Implemented"
- Update story file with completion date
- This signals to Step 1 (next workflow run) that story is ready for approval

**On Failure:**
- Report git errors
- Continue to Step 13 (do not abort)
- User can manually push later
- Do NOT update story status to "Implemented" if push fails

### **Step 13: Generate Completion Report**

**Agent:** `general-purpose` (acting as SM)
**Task:** Summarize workflow execution

**Report Sections:**
1. **Story Summary**
   - Story ID, title, status
   - Architect review iterations (if any)

2. **Implementation Summary**
   - Files created (count + list)
   - Files modified (count + list)
   - Tests run (count + results)

3. **Database Testing** (if applicable)
   - Migration status
   - RLS policy test results
   - Security advisor findings

4. **Git Status**
   - Commit hash (if pushed)
   - Push status (success/failed)

5. **Testing Summary** (NEW)
   - Brief list of features/scenarios to manually test
   - Extracted from story acceptance criteria and tasks
   - Focus on user-facing functionality and integration points
   - Example: "Test: Create template, Save template, Load template from list"

6. **Next Steps**
   - If all passed: "Manually test the features above, then run `*complete-story` again for next story"
   - If blocked: "Review errors and fix issues before approval"
   - If manual testing needed: "Perform manual testing of features listed above"

**Output File:** `{output_folder}/complete-story-report-{epic_num}.{story_num}.md`

## Error Handling

### **Story Creation Fails**
- **Action:** Abort workflow
- **Reason:** Cannot proceed without story
- **User Action:** Check epics.md for valid story definition, re-run workflow

### **Architect Rejects After Max Iterations**
- **Action:** Pause workflow, prompt user
- **Reason:** Story has fundamental issues requiring human review
- **User Action:** Manually review architect feedback, edit story, re-run from Step 2

### **Implementation Blocked**
- **Action:** Abort workflow, generate report
- **Reason:** Dev agent encountered errors or missing dependencies
- **User Action:** Review implementation errors, fix blockers, re-run `dev-story` workflow

### **Database Tests Fail**
- **Action:** Report failures, continue to GitHub push
- **Reason:** Tests may fail due to environment issues, not blocking
- **User Action:** Review test failures, fix database issues, re-test manually

### **Git Push Fails**
- **Action:** Report error, continue to completion report
- **Reason:** Git errors (conflicts, auth issues) don't invalidate implementation
- **User Action:** Manually resolve git issues and push

## Example Execution

### **Scenario:** Complete Story 3.6 (after testing Story 3.5)

```yaml
# User runs: *complete-story (after manually testing Story 3.5)

# Workflow execution:
Step 1: Dev approves story-3.5.md
  ‚úÖ Story 3.5 marked Done
  ‚úÖ Queue advanced: 3.6 ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS, 3.7 ‚Üí TODO
  ‚úÖ Story file: docs/stories/story-3.5.md ‚Üí Status: Done

Step 2: SM creates story-3.6.md (Draft)
  ‚úÖ Story file: docs/stories/story-3.6.md
  ‚úÖ Status: Draft

Step 3: Architect reviews story-3.6.md
  ‚ùå Verdict: REQUIRES CHANGES
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues: 3 critical issues found

Step 4: SM regenerates story-3.6.md with architect feedback
  ‚úÖ Story file: docs/stories/story-3.6.md (overwritten)
  ‚úÖ Status: Draft v2

Step 3 (iteration 2): Architect re-reviews story-3.6.md
  ‚úÖ Verdict: APPROVED
  ‚úÖ All issues resolved

Step 5: SM marks story-3.6.md as Ready
  ‚úÖ Status: Ready
  ‚úÖ Workflow-status updated

Step 6: SM generates story-context-3.6.xml
  ‚úÖ Context file: docs/stories/story-context-3.6.xml (279 lines)

Step 7: Dev implements story-3.6
  ‚úÖ Files created: 5
  ‚úÖ Files modified: 8
  ‚úÖ Build passed
  ‚úÖ Status: completed

Step 8: Build verification
  ‚úÖ npm run build: success
  ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors

Step 9: SM tests database operations
  ‚úÖ Migration executed
  ‚úÖ RLS policies tested (all passed)
  ‚úÖ Security advisors: 0 new issues

Step 10: Dev pushes to GitHub
  ‚úÖ Commit: b2c3d4e "Implement Story 3.6: Next Feature"
  ‚úÖ Pushed to origin/main

Step 11: SM generates completion report
  ‚úÖ Report: docs/complete-story-report-3.6.md
  ‚úÖ Next action: Manually test Story 3.6, then run *complete-story again for Story 3.7

# Total time: ~15 minutes (fully automated)
# User manually tests Story 3.6, then runs *complete-story again
```

## Troubleshooting

### **"No story found in workflow-status"**
- **Solution:** Check `TODO_STORY` field in workflow-status.md is populated

### **"Architect keeps rejecting story"**
- **Solution:** After 2 iterations, manually review epics.md and tech spec for clarity

### **"Dev agent reports blockers"**
- **Solution:** Check implementation errors, install missing dependencies, re-run workflow

### **"Database tests fail"**
- **Solution:** Verify Supabase MCP connection, check migration SQL syntax

### **"Git push fails with conflicts"**
- **Solution:** Pull latest changes, resolve conflicts, manually push

---

## Success Criteria

**Workflow is successful if:**
1. ‚úÖ Story created and approved by architect
2. ‚úÖ Story marked as Ready
3. ‚úÖ Implementation completed with no blockers
4. ‚úÖ Database tests passed (if applicable)
5. ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub
6. ‚úÖ Completion report generated

**Partial success if:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation completed but database tests failed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation completed but git push failed

**Failure if:**
- ‚ùå Story creation failed
- ‚ùå Architect rejected after max iterations
- ‚ùå Implementation blocked with errors

---

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Improvements:**
1. **Frontend Testing:** Add Playwright tests for UI changes
2. **Performance Testing:** Benchmark API endpoints before/after
3. **Security Scanning:** Integrate OWASP dependency check
4. **Deployment:** Auto-deploy to staging after successful tests
5. **Notifications:** Slack/email alerts on workflow completion
6. **Rollback:** Auto-rollback if production tests fail

---

## Related Workflows

- **create-story:** Story creation only (no architect review)
- **dev-story:** Implementation only (assumes story is ready)
- **story-context:** Context generation only
- **approve-story:** Final approval and status update (run after complete-story)
